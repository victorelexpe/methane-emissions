# Study of methane emissions

This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/methane-emissions-across-the-world-19902018) and gives the amout of CH4 emitted across the world.

The goal of this project is to _make the most out of this_ small dataset.

A small cleaning process was done to organize the data.

The results can be checked on Tableau Public. There are two dashboards.
- The [first](https://public.tableau.com/views/CountrystatusonCH4emissions/DashboardCountrystatus?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) one shows information by country.
- The [second](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalstatusonCH4emissions/DashboardGeneralstatus?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) dashboard gives a view of the global evolution.

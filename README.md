## Data

## Goal

The goal of this project is to _make the most out of this_ small dataset.


## Results

The results can be checked on Tableau Public. There are two dashboards.
- The [first](https://public.tableau.com/views/CountrystatusonCH4emissions/DashboardCountrystatus?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) one shows information by country.
- The [second](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalstatusonCH4emissions/DashboardGeneralstatus?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) dashboard gives a view of the global evolution.
